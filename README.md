## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.development.example .env.local
npm run dev:setup
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000/login and pick a persona: super admin, site admin, community lead, manager, volunteer, or student. Each one sees a different dashboard, resolved from the database exactly as in production. See [docs/local-dev.md](./docs/local-dev.md), and [docs/voss-auth.md](./docs/voss-auth.md) for connecting a real VOSS client.
